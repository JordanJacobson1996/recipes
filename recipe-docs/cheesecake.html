    <h1>Lemon Cheesecake</h1>
    <img src="../recipe-images/cheesecake.jpeg">
    <p>Who doesn't like cheesecake? When I was a kid I worked very hard to avoid cheesecake because at the time I had a thing against cheese. Then of course I tried some and didn't turn back.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200g plain biscuits </li>
        <li>125g butter, melted</li>
        <li>500g spreadable cream cheese, softened </li>
        <li>1/2 cup caster sugar </li>
        <li>2 tbsp lemon zest, plus extra to serve</li>
        <li>2 x free range eggs </li>
        <li>Whipped cream, to serve </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Lemon Curd</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp lemon zest </li>
        <li>1/4 cup lemon juice </li>
        <li>1/2 cup caster sugar</li>
        <li>40g butter, chopped, softened</li>
        <li>2 free range egg yolks, lightly whisked </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 180C or 160C fan. Grease a 20cm springform cake tin. Pulse biscuits in a food processor until finely chopped. Transfer to a bowl and add butter. Stir until combined. Spoon biscuit mixture into prepared cake tin and press evenly on base and sides. Cool in the fridge for at least 30 mins. </li>
        <li>In a medium-sized bowl, combine cream cheese, sugar and lemon zest with an electric mixer until smooth. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition, until combined. Pour mixture into tin and place on a baking tray. Bake for 25-30 mins, or until just set in the centre. Turn off oven and leave cheesecake in the oven with the door ajar for a couple of hours or until oven is completely cool. Chill in the fridge for 2 hrs. </li>
        <li> For the lemon curd, combine lemon zest, juice, sugar, butter and eggs in a saucepan over low heat. Cook, stirring, for 5-10 mins, or until mixture thickens. Strain through a fine sieve onto a dinner plate or flat tray (this helps the lemon curd cool more quickly). </li>
        <li>Pour curd over cheesecake. Chill in the fridge until serving.</li>
        <li>Serve cheesecake with whipped cream and lemon zest. </li>
    </ol>
